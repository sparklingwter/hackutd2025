# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## Local development database

- The default `.env` targets a SQLite database stored at `prisma/dev.db`, so `npm run dev` works without Docker.
- To use MySQL instead, change the datasource `provider` in `prisma/schema.prisma`, update `DATABASE_PROVIDER`/`DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, then run `start-database.sh` (requires Docker or Podman).
- After changing providers, run `npx prisma db push` to sync the schema and regenerate the Prisma client.

## How do I deploy this?

Follow our deployment guides for [Vercel](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel), [Netlify](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/netlify) and [Docker](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/docker) for more information.
